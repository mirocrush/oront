I am gonna build my own developer portfolio website using React + Webpack +  three.js.
You are gonna build the portfolio based on the resume.txt
The portfolio should look professional and smart in design.
The portfolio should be able to toggle white/dark mode.
The concept color should be same with linkedin's skyblue.
In overall design, I prefer linkedin's design.
In general meaning, you need to implement the all general developer portfolios do.
This is the early stage of my portfolio development.
I will give you additional requirements on and on.

And please create claude.md file in root path of this projects so that every time I gave you prompt,
you can append my command and your results.
So that once I restart prompt, you can get full understanding of status from this claude.md file.
